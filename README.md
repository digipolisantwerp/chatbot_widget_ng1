# Chatbot Smart Widget UI (AngularJS)

With the chatbot smart widget you can simply implement a chatbot in any page.

You will also need the BFF package in order to get the chatbot smart widget to work: [http://github.com/digipolisantwerp/chatbot_service_nodejs](http://github.com/digipolisantwerp/chatbot_service_nodejs)
